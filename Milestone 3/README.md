## MileStone 3: Application Layer

The application layer was implemented using Pythonanywhere which is an online integrated development environment and web hosting service. I used React js for frontend, Node js for server side and MySql for the backend which is also set-up on pythonanywhere.

To run the project:
1. open pythonanywhere.com
2. Login using the following credentials:
	username: dareenhussein
	password: dareen123
3. Open the following link ()
4. Reload multiple times until successful opening or use the following link (https://premium-leageue.web.app)

You will find all the required functionalities in the one page where it will ask you to enter specific data to get the needed information.

I have done the following bonuses: 
1. Identifying teams in UK. 
2. Web-based GUI application.


#NB: The server is down sometimes as it's a free-tool.
